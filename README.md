PaperWallet Challenge

This is a React Native Expo app that allows users to take photos, save them to the device, and display them in a grid view. The app uses Context API for state management.
Getting Started

To get started with the app, you will need to have Expo CLI installed on your machine. If you don't have it installed, you can install it by running the following command:

npm install -g expo-cli

After installing Expo CLI, clone this repository to your local machine using the command:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/PaperWalletChallenge.git

Next, navigate to the project directory and install the project dependencies by running the command: npm install

Running the App

This will start the server and open a browser window with a QR code that you can scan with your phone to open the app on the Expo Go app. Alternatively, you can run the app on an iOS or Android simulator or emulator.
